<p>My favourite three album releases are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>The Bends</dt>
<dd>The Bends was released in 1995. It was produced by John Leckie, and engineered 
<br>by Nigel Godrich, who has produced all of Radiohead's subsequent studio albums.</dd>
<dt>Amnesiac</dt>
<dd>Amnesiac was released in 2001. Recorded with producer Nigel Godrich during the
<br> same sessions as Radiohead's previous album Kid A, Amnesiac incorporates similar 
<br>influences of electronic music, 20th-century classical music, jazz and krautrock.</dd>
<dt>OK Computer</dt>
<dd>OK Computer was released in 1997. The members of Radiohead self-produced the 
<br>album with Nigel Godrich.</dd>
